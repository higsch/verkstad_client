Tasks to be done.

## What does this piece of software do?

This is vue.js-based todo app, which serves and is intended to organize tasks for the maintenance of
[modern proteomics mass spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry).

Each day one has to check the injection needles, run quality control
samples, or exchange liquid chromatography components. In order to keep
an overview of all these tasks, the **Verkstad** app for mass spec
maintenance was developed and is now applied in the [Lehti√∂ laboratory](http://lehtiolab.se).

The frontend (which you see here) is able to commuicate with a
[server-based node.js app](https://github.com/mtstahl/verkstad_server), which
maintaines a sqlite database.
